                <h2>Applied Computer Science Student</h2>
                <p>Hello, I'm Sohaib Ibenhajene, a Applied Computer Science student from Belgium. I first fell in 
                    love with IT at the age of 14, when I built my first computer. 
                    Since then I've been learning more and more about IT.
                    I truly love programming, especially when it comes to Back-End. I love working in 
                    team especially when I can learn from the people I'm working with. Besides programming 
                    I do multiple sports like Jiu Jitsu, Fitness and Boxing. <br>I look forward to a career in development where I can put my skills to good use.
                    Feel free to scroll trough my online portfolio and get to know me better.</p>

                <p>As an Applied Computer Science student, I've developed a variety of technical and soft skills that 
                    make me a valuable addition to any team. This section highlights my top four skills, including my ability 
                    to overcome obstacles and see projects through to completion, and my knowledge in relevant programming 
                    languages and database management.</p>

                    <h2>Perseverance</h2>
                    <p>Perseverance is one of my greatest strengths. I never 
                        give up when working towards a goal, and always see a 
                        task through to completion. My strong commitment to 
                        achieving success, no matter how challenging the task, 
                        sets me apart and helps me succeed in both personal and 
                        professional goals.</p>

                    <h2>Communication</h2>
                    <p>Communication is one of my strengths. As a good team worker, 
                        I prioritize clear and effective communication. I listen 
                        actively and ensure that I understand 
                        needs of others. My communication skills help me build strong 
                        relationships and make valuable contributions to every project 
                        or team.</p>

                    <h2>Java</h2>
                    <p>Java programming, particularly with Thymeleaf, is a passion of 
                        mine. I enjoy developing robust and scalable applications and 
                        am always eager to learn from others to expand my skills. 
                        I look forward to exploring even more of what this powerful 
                        and flexible language has to offer.</p>

                    <h2>MySQL</h2>
                    <p>Working with databases, especially MySQL, is something that 
                        I really enjoy, and I'm excited to learn more about its possibilities. 
                        While I'm not yet an expert, I do have experience with implementing 
                        databases into web applications. I look forward to learning more about 
                        what MysQL has to offer.</p>

                            basic understanding of their company. We followed this up 
                            with more meetings to get feedback from the client. Finally 
                            we had to present all of our prototypes to the client.</p>

                            In the end, I chose to create a Maze Game. It's a small 2d game, 
                            where you have move your cursor trough a difficult maze. You have 
                            a limited amount of lives and your time is also recorded. 
                            So, if you're fast you can land a nice spot on the leaderboard.</p>

                            Finally we had to make a working php webapplication based on the
                            prototypes and the feedback from the client. Our client wanted a

                            languages. We called it EZTyping. We made a website where you can

                                <p>A group project for Requirements Analysis where our 
                                    goal was solving all of the problems of our client 
                                    and developing the plans for a future application that they will be using. 
                                    We solved these issues by creating an accurate use 
                                    case model and getting feedback from the client. 
                                    With this use case model we could then create prototypes for the application.</p>
                                <p>My role in this project was creating prototypes and 
                                    helping with the design of the use case model.
                                    Also during our meetings with the client, I asked 
                                    questions to get a better understanding of the client's 
                                    needs. During this project, I improved my communication 
                                    skills by always communicating clearly both verbally and written.</p>

                                <p>I created a maze game using Windows Forms. 
                                    It was programmed in c# and I also implemented a SQLite database. 
                                    The game is very simple, first you can choose your difficulty 
                                    and fill in your username. Once you click play you'll be placed 
                                    inside the maze, you then have get to the end as fast as possible 
                                    without touching the walls. If you touch a wall you'll be brought 
                                    back to the beginning and lose a life. Depending on the difficulty 
                                    you'll have more or less lives. Once you finish you'll be presented 
                                    with a screen where you can see your score and also all the other highscores.</p>
                                <p>During this project I sharpened my c# skills and worked with a SQLite 
                                    database for the first time. It is the first game that I created and defenitely 
                                    not the last. I really enjoyed working on this project, because it was so rewarding.
                                    After coding for hours, I could actually start playing my game.<br>

                                <p>I am currently still working on the project with my team. The 
                                    project is about creating a webapplication for a client. We 
                                    are using the Scrum method to create the webapplication. We 
                                    are using PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Livewire, Tailwind and MySQL for
                                    the project. We are working well as a team, everyone has to do their bit and we are
                                    always helping each other out. I was mostly responsible for the 
                                    registration part of the application. We are currently still working on the project.
                                    But soon it will be finished!</p>
                                <p>During this project I sharpened my php skills and worked with a 
                                    MySQL database. My webdesign skills also improved a lot and I 
                                    definitely improved my problem solving skills. I also learned 
                                    how to work with the Scrum method and how to work in a team.
                                    I'm very thankful for my team, because they have always helped 
                                    me and we worked well together.

                                <p>I created a learning website using HTML, JavaScript and Sass. I used
                                    Sass for the first time and at first it was really difficult. But once
                                    I got the hang of it, it was really easy to use. I also used a lot of
                                    animations and transitions to make the website more interactive. I also
                                    used JavaScript for the very first time. I used it to create a hamburger
                                    menu for the mobile version of the website. The website was basically made 
                                    for a made up company, that would sell courses to learn how to code in 
                                    different programming languages.</p>
                                <p>During this project I got better at leading a team and I also learned how to work
                                    with the Scrum method. I also learned how to work with Sass and JavaScript. I also
                                    learned how to deal with problems that occur during teamwork in a project. Such as 
                                    bad communication, sometimes not meeting deadlines and not doing your part of the project.
                                    But all of these stuggles ultimately made us a stronger team, because we learned from our
                                    mistakes and we learned how to deal with these problems. So, I'm very thankful for my team.
